# Lists-and-dictionaries

This project demonstrates different uses for lists and dictionaries in Python. Specifically:

Creates a list menu containing four items: "sandwich", "cake", "water", and "tea".
Creates two dictionaries: stock_value and stock_price.
stock_value stores the number of each item in stock.
stock_price stores the price of each item.

Initializes a variable total_stock_worth to 0.
Iterates through the menu list using a for loop.
For each item, retrieves its price from stock_price and quantity from stock_value.
Calculates the total value of the item by multiplying the price and quantity.
Adds the item's value to the total_stock_worth.
Prints the total value of the current item.
Prints the final total_stock_worth.
